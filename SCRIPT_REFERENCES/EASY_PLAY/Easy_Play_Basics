TERMS AND DEFINITIONS:
@           - Code Block - where a set of commands is stored to run a specific task
Data        - Refers to CustomData area
Echo        - Refers to display bottom right
Controller  - Cockpit, Remote Controller...

DATA TYPES:
There are 5 data types that are defined by the representation of a variable:
    - Boolean type - can have two values ​​True or False
    - Number (Number) - a positive or negative number with a decimal point, the boundary values ​​of which are determined by the game properties of the block.
    - Color (Color) is the RGB representation of a triad of colors separated by ":", such as 0:0:255 (blue).
    - GPS coordinatesis a triad of X:Y:Z, for example " GPS:Base:-62664.81 : -80178.37:-27915.08:# ".
    - String (String) - Below is the initialization and output to the console of three string variables
        @vars { 
            name = Iroquois 
            type = "Impact Media" 
            value = "" 
        } 
        @view { 
            Console = "\name \N \type \value" 
        }

@ Code Block will run a list of commands set out start and end with {} 
Additionally, in parentheses "()", separated by a comma ",", you can specify the parameters that can be accessed inside the @-block by serial number.
Example:
@move_piston { 
    UpperLimit of MyPiston = 1.5 
    Reverse MyPiston 
}

CALLING VARIABLES:
    @variables {
        x = 100
    }

    @test {
        Velocity of Piston 1 = \x   // "\" symbol looks and calls variable requested
    }

KNOWN COMMANDS:
    * - Comment     {* Anything on the same line of this asterix will be ignored}
    # - Hash        {Override #Gyros} - will cause all gyroscopes to be overridden if their name begins with Gyro
    ! - Exclamation {Override ! Gyroscope 1} - will the interception be performed only for one gyroscope named Gyroscope 1
    ? - Question    {Override ?gyro turn} - will override all gyroscopes that have words beginning with "gyro" and "turn"
    () - Groups     {Override (Gyroscopes)} - Overrides all gyroscopes in that group

    Grid    
        {MyGrid} - (main grid) - blocks located on the grid in which the Easy Play PB is installed
        {AllGrid} - MyGrid and all subgrids connected to the main one through dynamic blocks - rotors, hinges, pistons
        {MyShip} - AllGrid and all what is docked to it through the connectors
        {Grid_Name} - For example, " Unlock Connector on SE Escape Pod" will detach all connectors of the shuttle named "SE Escape Pod"
